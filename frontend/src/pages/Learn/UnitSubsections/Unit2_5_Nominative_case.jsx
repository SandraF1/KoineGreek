      <h2>2.5 Nominative case</h2>
      <p>
        The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence. The subject
        is the doer or performer of the action or verb. In English, we say: I
        threw the ball. We would never say: Me threw the ball, because in
        English me is not used for the subject of a sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Greek, the nominative case takes a specific set of endings, depending
        on the family of nouns those words belong to. These groups or families
        of words are known as declensions. The first declension nouns are a
        group of nouns, largely feminine, that share a pattern of endings, as
        below in the nominative:
      </p>
      <p>ἀρχή, φωνή, ἀγάπη</p>
      <p>
        These all end in eta. The eta endings distinguish the nominative nouns
        from the other nouns in the first declension family.
