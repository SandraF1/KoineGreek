      <h2>1.6 Accents</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, you may notice that there are sometimes small marks over the
        syllables in Greek. Greek was originally a tonal language and these
        marks indicated pitch. They are called accent marks. These tones not
        longer indicate pitch, but they do indicate where the stress lies. For
        example, in English we say, ‘hel – LO’ and not ‘HEL – lo’. The second
        syllable is pronounced louder and stronger, indicating that it is a
        stressed syllable. In Greek, accent marks are useful for distinguishing
        between forms that are otherwise identical. These will be pointed out as
        we go along. You do not need to write the accent marks on the syllables,
        but you do need to say them with the right stress. The names of the
        accent marks are as follows:

              A curly mark or carat, originally indicating a tone that rose and
