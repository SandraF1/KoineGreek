        It is worth noting that in feminine nouns with the alpha stem, nouns
        spelt the following way might be either genitive singular or accusative
        plural: χώρας may be either.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if the feminine article accompanies the word, it is then
        possible to easily distinguish between the two:
      </p>
      <p>τῆς χώρας genitive singular</p>
      <p>τὰς χώρας accusative plural</p>
    </section>
  );
}
