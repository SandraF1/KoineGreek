      <h2>1.5 Breathing marks</h2>

      <p>
        Breathing marks are found over initial vowels. A smooth breathing mark
        has no sound but a rough breathing mark is pronounced with an h sound. A
        rough breathing mark can also occur before a rho, and is pronounced with
        an h sound before the r sound of the rho.
