      <h2>Introduction to Personal Pronouns in Koine Greek</h2>
      <p>
        In English, we have short words that replace nouns or proper nouns. For
        example, instead of saying,
        <em> “My neighbour grows strawberries”</em>, we might say,
        <em> “He grows strawberries.”</em> <strong>He</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>she </strong>
        and <strong>it</strong> are examples of{" "}
        <strong>personal pronouns</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Koine Greek, personal pronouns exist as well, and have number and case,
        and in the third person, also gender.
