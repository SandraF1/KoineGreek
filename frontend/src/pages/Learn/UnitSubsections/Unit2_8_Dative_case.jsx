      <h2>2.8 Dative case</h2>
      <p>
        The dative case indicates the indirect object. For example, in the
        sentence ‘Bob cooked Jim a meal, the meal is directly connected to the
        verb ‘cook’, and Jim is indirectly affected by this action as he eats
        the meal. In English, the particles ‘to’ or ‘for’ can indicate the
        indirect object, as in: ‘Bob cooked the meal for Jim.’ Look at the
        endings below:
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is not natural English, as we would be more likely to say ‘He
        is my sister’s husband’, it demonstrates that the genitive exists also
        in English. Look at the genitive first declension nouns below:
      </p>
      <p>ἀρχῃ, φωνῃ, ἀγαπῃ</p>
      <p>
        The eta with the iota subscript identifies the dative case. It is part
        of the spelling and grammar of the word, distinguishing it from the
        nominative, and must always be written with the dative first declension
        noun.
