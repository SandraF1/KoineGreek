      <h2>1.1 The Alphabet</h2>
      <p>
        In the earliest manuscripts, the Greek New Testament was written in
        capital letters only and without punctuation.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, critical editions now use both upper and lower case, as well as
        punctuation. For this reason, it is important to recognise both the
        upper and lower case alphabet. You will also need to learn to write the
        lower case alphabet for the purposes of study.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a chart with the letter, its name, and its Erasmian
        pronunciation.
