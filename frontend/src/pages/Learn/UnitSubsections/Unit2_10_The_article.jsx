      <h2>2.10 The article</h2>
      <p>
        In English, we use ‘a/an’ (the indefinite article) and ‘the’ (the
        definite article). In Greek, there is no word corresponding to ‘a/an’,
        but there is a word for ‘the’. Like the noun, this definite article has
        number, gender and case. Its endings are exactly those of the first noun
        declension endings. We saw it in the previous chart, preceding each
        noun.
