      <p>
        Since the subject is always included in the Greek verb, personal
        pronouns are not technically necessary to communicate information about
        the subject. However, the pronoun is sometimes included for{" "}
        <strong>emphatic or contrastive use</strong>:
      </p>

      <blockquote className="border-start ps-3">
        <p>
          Then they hurled insults at him and said, &ldquo;
          <strong>You (σύ)</strong> are this fellow’s disciple!
          <strong>We (ἡμεῖς)</strong> are disciples of Moses!&rdquo; (John 9:28 NIV)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
