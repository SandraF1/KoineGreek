      <h2>1.4 Syllabification</h2>

      <p>
        To syllabify, each syllable must take one vowel. Consonant clusters are
        important to recognise becuase they affect syllabification. Double
        consonants are separated, with one of them ending a syllable and the
        other opening a syllable. However, some consonant clusters are not
        separated and belong together in one syllable. To check if a pair of
        consonants is a legitimate single cluster, check the dictionary and see
        if any words begin with that pair of consonants, although not every
        cluster pronounced as one cluster is attested at the starts of words. In
        addition, Greek syllables will start with a consonant rather than a
        vowel, if possible.

      <p>πάτταλος = πάτ-τα-λος (double consonants split)</p>
      <p>
        σχολείο = σχο-λείο (single consonant cluster with sigma and chi
        pronounced as one sound)
      </p>

      <p>
        ἄνθρωπος = ἄν-θρω-πος (single consonant cluster with theta and rho
        treated as one sound)
      </p>
      <p>
        λόγος - λό-γος (second consonant gamma opens the second syllable, as
        Greek words prefer to start syllables with consonants, where possible)
