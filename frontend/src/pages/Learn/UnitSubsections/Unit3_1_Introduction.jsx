      <h2>3.1 Introduction to second declension nouns</h2>
      <p>
        Second declension nouns are the next pattern we will learn. These nouns
        are distinct from the first declension nouns, since they have a
        different set of endings. Second declension nouns are largely masculine
        or neuter, with some similarity between the masculine and neuter
        endings.
