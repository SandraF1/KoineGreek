          <p>
            We have already studied the personal pronoun. There are a few more
            groups of pronouns in Greek, namely, the demonstrative pronoun, the
            reflexive pronoun, the reciprocal pronoun, the interrogative pronoun
            and the indefinite pronoun. We will also study the pronominal
            adjective.
