      <h2>2.3 Gender</h2>
      <p>
        Like several other languages, Greek nouns have grammatical gender. In
        English, gender is conceptual and inherent in the meaning of a word,
        such as ‘rooster’ (male), ‘hen’ (female) or ‘chick’ (either male or
        female). Most words do not have either a male, female or neuter form in
        English and therefore do not carry gender.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Greek, gender is grammatical but does not always reflect the meaning
        of a word. For example, ‘love’ is a feminine word in Greek, even though
        its meaning is not always associated with a woman. ‘Word’ is a masculine
        noun. A few nouns in Greek have both male and female form.
