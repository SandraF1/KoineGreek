      <h2>2.7 Genitive case</h2>
      <p>
        The genitive case indicates possession. In English, we use the particle
        ‘of’ to indicate possession: He is the husband of my sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is not natural English, as we would be more likely to say ‘He
        is my sister’s husband’, it demonstrates that the genitive exists also
        in English. Look at the genitive first declension nouns below:
      </p>
      <p>ἀγάπης, φωνῆς, ἀρχῆς</p>
      <p>The –ης ending is the first declension genitive singular ending.</p>
