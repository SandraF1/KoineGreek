      <p className="mb-3">
        There is a rare fifth case of direct address, which can have an
        exclamative function, especially when combined with the omega. This case
        is used when quoting direct speech, when one person addresses one or
        more others. For example, in English, we may quote someone as saying ‘O
        King, may your live forever!’ This may also be expressed less strongly
        and without the ‘O’, for example, ‘Sir, you know.’ It is usually used in
        quotations, where one person speaks to another, since the
        reader/listener is rarely addressed directly by the writer of Scripture.
        However, a clear example of this is Galatians 3:1, where Paul addresses
        his audience as ‘O foolish Galatians!’
