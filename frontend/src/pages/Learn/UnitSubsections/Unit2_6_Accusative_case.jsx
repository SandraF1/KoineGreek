      <h2>2.6 Accusative case</h2>
      <p>
        The accusative case is the direct object. It is directly affected by the
        verbal action: ‘I loved the book’, ‘I watched the movie’, ‘I liked the
        meal.’ Book, movie and meal - these are all examples of the accusative
        case. Look at the noun pattern below:
      </p>
      <p>ἀρχήν, φωνήν, ἀγάπην</p>
      <p>The –ην ending is the first declension genitive singular ending.</p>
